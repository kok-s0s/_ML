## How i learn

> Microsoft learning documentation is very well done, i just need to read it, practice the code it provides, and experience the charm of code.

1. just read!

2. just copy `demo code` and use `ipython` or `jupyter` to run it!

> There needs to be a good network. (dddd / doge~

3. just try!

And time to write my code!
